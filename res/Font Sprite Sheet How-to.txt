I don't know why exactly, but editing these character sprite sheets is a major PITA.

For the love of GOD, do the following:
Keep the original working character set image nearby and UNTOUCHED!
This may not be a requirement, but keep the resolution of your edited sheet the exact same as the original.
DO NOT move the magenta markers at the top of the sprite sheet.
While the above two things may not actually be required, it will help you to keep your sanity.

Copy the working sprite sheet image to perform whatever edits you may wish to make.
You're also plenty fine to convert your copy of the image to a BMP to simplify simple sprite edits.

Make sure to keep the characters' dimensions within the "borders" of the above magenta markers at the top of the sheet.

Once you're done editing the characters, fill the entire sprite sheet with cyan (Red=0, Green=255, Blue=255).
This is so you can inspect the image to make sure there aren't any "stray" pixels that don't belong.
If you see any stray pixels that shouldn't be, color them in with the same cyan color to rid of them.
This is ESPECIALLY true if any trailing pixels managed to make their way next to the magenta markers atop.
To ensure the magenta markers don't get screwed up, I also removed them by coloring them in making those all cyan as well.
I did this so that it will match the transparent color so they may remain in-tact in the original working sprite sheet image.

Once the image is cleaned up, you're welcome to leave the cyan fill in the image.
You could change the cyan fill to all white if desired, too.
Just so long as there's a color that can be made "invisible" for transparency across the image.

After saving, open the file with Irfanview.
Select 'Save as'
Choose PNG
Tick the box for 'Save Transparent Color'
For this particular case even though it shouldn't matter, set compression level to '0'
Click on the transparent color for your edited spritesheet (whether you made it white or cyan)

Open GIMP
Open the transparent sprite sheet file you just saved with Irfanview
Press Ctrl + A to select all (or click 'Select' from the menu and click 'All')
Press Ctrl + C to copy the selection (or click 'Edit' from the menu and click 'Copy')
You may close this file now that you've copied it to the clipboard.

Now open the original working sprite sheet image.
IMPORTANT: It's going to ask about importing from a color profile. Click 'Keep' to not change the original!
Now press Ctrl + V (or click 'Edit' from the menu and click 'Paste')
If you're lucky, all of your characters will be lined up and you won't have to move them into place.
If they lined up nicely, in the Layers Panel right-click the 'Pasted Layer' and click 'Anchor Layer'.
If it looks good and it looks right, go to 'File' and click 'Export as'.
Select PNG from the dropdown at the lower part of the window with 'Select File Type (By Extension)'.
Choose your location to save your file and give it a filename as you normally would.
Click 'Export'
THE FOLLOWING IS IMPORTANT - this is to retain the metadata that makes the original spritesheet work:
In the 'Export image as PNG window, make sure to set the following options:
[ ] Interlacing (Adam7)          (We don't want interlacing)
[ ] Save background color        (It's assumed that this setting might affect the transparency layer)
[X] Save gamma                   (This may not be required, but it worked having this option ticked)
[ ] Save layer offset            (This wasn't necessary and probably isn't even used)
[X] Save resolution              (I'd say this one is pretty important)
[ ] Save creation time           (This is completely optional)
[ ] Save comment                 (This is also completely optional.  Probably rarely used anyway)
[X] Save color values from transparent pixels  (This is very important as it stores critical image data)
  (from the dropdown, you can choose 'automatic pixelformat', but it's likely'8bpc RGBA' already)
  (Compression level = 6)
[X] Save Exif data               (This is assumed to be important and the original image has this metadata)
[X] Save XMP data                (Not sure about this, but it worked when having it selected)
[ ] Save IPTC data               (Not sure what this is for exactly, but it wasn't needed here)
[ ] Save thumbnail               (Where this image is going to be used, this is pointless and increases the file size)
[X] Save color profile           (This is also important as the color profile provides critical image data)

Once exported with the above settings and regimen, we should now have a working character sprite sheet.
