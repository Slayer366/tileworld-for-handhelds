"Natural" Resource Set for Tile World / Chip's Challenge


=====
ABOUT
=====

The 'natural' resource set contains some new graphics and sounds for Tile World / Chip's Challenge. The graphics alter the appearance to that of a natural grass, stone and wood environment, instead of a clubhouse.

Some of the new stuff is explained below:-

Grass - Most of the action takes place on the grassy plains - a happy habitat for Chip as well as all the monsters.

Stone Walls - These solid walls are as hard as... er... rock.

Sponge - Chip can tear aside this foam-like blue material to reveal what it was covering. It might be a wall, or it could simply be empty grass. Monsters always avoid the toxic sponge until Chip gets rid of it.

Driftwood Fences - These things may look rickety but they are firmly rooted into the ground and cannot be crossed. They might have holes in the middle - just wide enough for Chip to stick his arms through to push a block on the other side.

Wooden Blocks - These are light enough for Chip to push, yet heavy enough to hold down a button. If they slide onto Chip, the momentum is enough to kill him.

Mud - While monsters avoid mud, Chip can fearlessly walk into it. But then it sticks to his shoes and clears away, and the monsters can then enter that ground. It also impedes the movement of blocks. Pushing a block into water creates a huge splash that brings up all the mud from the riverbed.

Stone Platforms - These platforms may either be sunk in the grass, or raised high enough to block anything from crossing them. Pressing a green button causes all raised platforms to sink and vice versa. If Chip or a monster is standing on one of these when it rises, they can still jump off onto a vacant side.

Burrows - A burrow is home to hordes of monsters. Thankfully for Chip, they don't come out unless a red button linked to that burrow is pressed. A member of the family that inhabits the burrow stands guard atop it. Chip is expected to respect the privacy of monsters and is forbidden from trying to enter a burrow, whether or not it is occupied.

Quicksand - Pits of quicksand can be found in some places. Luckily, they are quite small and shallow. If Chip wants to be brave, he can walk in and out of them, but at the cost of losing any special shoes he's wearing. Monsters know what's good for them and avoid these. Like mud, blocks cannot be moved across quicksand.

Lava - Bubbling molten lava means instant death to all creatures that try to pass over it, except fireballs. Chip can manage to walk over it only if he has special boots.

Notes - Melinda and the Bit Busters sometimes leave around these hastily scribbled-on pieces of paper with helpful hints on them... just in case Chip gets totally stumped.

Potato Chips - Crunch... munch... mmmm... Chip loves these, but the carnivorous monsters turn away from them - perhaps waiting for a juicier snack...

Bottlecaps - These are held down by vacuum and block the way, until Chip can muster the strength to prise them open. He can do this only by eating a sufficient number of chips. Once he does that, they pop high into the air and disappear into space.

COMMENTS
========

To give the appearance of a plain field, the grass tiles do not have any outline. Due to this, grass boundaries adjacent to water look somewhat unusual. Also, the inventory area that shows the keys and boots looks odd at first sight.
A row of fences appearing to be slanted is a cool optical illusion that wasn't planned for.
The computer chips and socket were initially intended to be replaced by diamonds and a ring; but then, due to the ubiquitous word "chip" in many level titles and the 'chips remaining' area, this was changed.
Changes to the exit, force floor, ice and water tiles may be added in the future.

LICENCE
=======

This resource set is freeware. Most of the graphics and sounds were made by editing free graphics and sound resources obtained from the Internet. Certain portions of the distributed graphics are derived from the original Tile World graphics. In general, anything you do with these files should be okay - so long as it is to further the enjoyment of Tile World or Chip's Challenge.
