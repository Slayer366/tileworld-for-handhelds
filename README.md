TileWorld-for-Handhelds
=======================

A port of Tile World to handheld consoles such as the Anbernic RG351P, RG351MP, RG503, RG353P, and others.

This modified version for the Anbernic handhelds will require sdl12-compat which can be found at https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl12-compat.

This version has been modified to use the higher resolution spritesheets for improved graphical detail.
